## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 or higher (current LTS)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Optional: [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (`brew install just` or `cargo install just`)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/projectbluefin/website
cd website
npm install
```

### Dev server

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run preview    # Preview production build locally
```

With `just`:

```bash
just build    # Build for production
just serve    # Preview the production build locally
```

### Linting and formatting

Uses [`@antfu/eslint-config`](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) for both linting and formatting. Run before every PR:

```bash
npm run lint        # Check for lint errors
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix lint errors
npm run typecheck   # Type-check with vue-tsc
```

## Wolves soundtrack metadata

The Wolves soundtrack metadata is refreshed locally with:

```bash
npm run update:wolves-playlist
```

This workflow requires [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to read the public YouTube playlist and writes the checked-in manifest to `public/wolves-playlist.json`. The frontend consumes that checked-in file directly, so no YouTube Data API key is exposed to browsers.

## Back catalogue and experience manifests

The Wolves lobby's Back Catalogue grid (below the QR codes) lists every album from `music.projectbluefin.io`. It is regenerated locally with:

```bash
npm run update:back-catalogue
```

This requires `yt-dlp`. It reads the album index from the documentation repo's published `playlist-metadata.json`, copies each cover byte-for-byte to `public/experiences/<playlistId>.jpg`, resolves each playlist's tracks, and writes the checked-in `public/experiences/catalogue.json`. Re-run it to pick up new albums; the frontend consumes the checked-in file directly.

Each catalogue entry is an experience manifest — the declarative format the cinematic runtime plays. The schema lives in `src/config/experience-manifest.ts` with three complete inline examples covering the canonical shapes:

- **Image-based album**: `kind: 'image'` segments with `imageUrl`, `durationSeconds`, and per-slide text via `captionsText`.
- **YouTube playlist with synced text**: `kind: 'youtube'` segments with `youtubeId`, authored `durationSeconds`, and `seconds|text` caption cues keyed to the video's native timeline.
- **Mixed media**: stills interleaved with trimmed video (`startSeconds`/`endSeconds`, per-segment `crossfadeMs`).

A manifest also carries launcher metadata (`title`, `subtitle`, `artwork`, `credits`). The Wolves tour itself is the default manifest (`WOLVES_EXPERIENCE` in `src/stores/cinematic.ts`); albums load through the same `loadExperience()` store action and render through the identical stage, transitions, transport, and seek behavior. New experiences are authored by writing a manifest — no renderer changes.

The `/wolves` player starts only after a visitor clicks the control. Its YouTube iframe is retained as a hidden 200x200 audio player because the IFrame API requires that minimum viewport; do not replace it with a visible video widget or shrink it to 1px. The visible panel includes a YouTube Music deep link and sign-in/Premium guidance.

## Wolves local video capture

For deterministic, repeatable local Track 0 rendering (manual upload flow):

```bash
npm run dev
npm run record:wolves
```

Defaults:
- local-only URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/wolves/`
- output: `recordings/wolves-first-song-1440p.mp4`
- 1440p at 25fps (matching Playwright capture), CPU-capped FFmpeg encode for lower OOM risk

Optional overrides:

```bash
node record-wolves.cjs \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:5174/wolves/ \
  --output /tmp/wolves.mp4 \
  --threads 4 \
  --fps 30 \
  --duration 424
```
