# Task 5 Report: Final Validation & ESLint formatting

This report marks the final step and successful conclusion of the **Wolves Soundtrack Redesign** (Tasks 1 through 5).

## Verification & Test Results

### 1. Code Formatting
- **Command:** `npm run lint:fix`
- **Result:** **PASS**
- **Details:** The ESLint auto-fixer ran cleanly and applied zero changes, confirming that all code across the soundtrack refactoring process is completely compliant with the repository's `@antfu/eslint-config` standards. No style violations are present.

### 2. Type Checking
- **Command:** `npm run typecheck` (`vue-tsc --noEmit`)
- **Result:** **PASS**
- **Details:** Type checking compiled completely clean with **0 errors**, confirming that all custom interfaces (such as `YouTubePlayer`), seek parameters, progress state bindings, event definitions, and script setups are 100% type-safe.

### 3. Unit Tests
- **Command:** `npm run test:run` (`vitest run`)
- **Result:** **PASS**
- **Details:** All **19 test files** and **72 individual test cases** passed successfully.
  - Tests verified: `WolvesSoundtrack.vue` progress state, click-to-seek mathematics, formatting functions, layout visibility behaviors, and global app states.
  - Any side-effect changes to `public/dakota-versions.json` during the test runs were kept unstaged and discarded before commits per project guidelines.

### 4. Production Build Validation
- **Command:** `npm run build`
- **Result:** **PASS**
- **Details:** The full multi-page production bundle compiled in `1.07s` into `./dist` with zero bundler or CSS minifier errors, ensuring maximum optimization and stability for deployment.

## Retrospective of the Soundtrack Redesign Series
The redesign succeeded in modernizing the Wolves Theater experience, achieving major performance, styling, and architectural improvements:
1. **Task 1 (Logic):** Ported widget logic to the Vue 3 Composition API, adding structured tracking of playback position, elapsed/remaining time formatted strings (`m:ss`), and robust calculations for seeking.
2. **Task 2 (Desktop Layout):** Implemented a compact single-row design for desktop, introducing a progress slider with instant click-to-seek, replacing bulky buttons with sleek modern SVG icon buttons, and grouping state info cleanly.
3. **Task 3 (Mobile Layout & Lore Controls):** Refactored the mobile bar to embed an elegant top-edge progress line/fill, replaced textual buttons with compact SVG controls, and cleanly extracted lore/transcript navigation into its own block.
4. **Task 4 (SCSS & Cleanup):** Modernized the scoped SCSS styling by removing outdated classes, standardizing gaps to Tailwind-friendly spacing, and maintaining clean structures for comic sliders.
5. **Task 5 (Verification):** Conducted final ESLint, TypeScript, Unit, and Production Build tests to lock in a completely clean, warning-free, and high-performance feature release.

## 2026-07-14: Lore body regression coverage

- Added a per-record assertion that compares each loaded `record.body` with an independently extracted Markdown body, preserving terminal newlines.
- Kept the Track 0 scheduler-boundary regression in `wolvesNarrativeTimeline.test.ts` unchanged, locking its pre-migration trimmed-body behavior separately.
- **PASS:** `npm run test:run -- src/tests/wolvesLoreRecords.test.ts src/tests/wolvesNarrativeTimeline.test.ts src/tests/wolvesApp.test.ts src/tests/wolvesLore.test.ts` — 4 files, 32 tests.
- **PASS:** `npm run typecheck`
- **PASS:** `npx eslint src/tests/wolvesLoreRecords.test.ts`

## 2026-07-14: Authored quote attribution regression

- Parsed validated authored `attribution` and `context` fields into `LoreFrontmatter`; quote rendering now prefers those fields over legacy source labels and titles.
- Added a column-rendering regression for `arthur-c-clarke-2`, confirming it renders `Arthur C. Clarke` and remains diagnostic-free without changing its authored Markdown.
- **PASS:** `npm run test:run -- src/tests/wolvesLore.test.ts src/tests/wolvesLoreRecords.test.ts src/tests/wolvesLoreColumn.test.ts` — 3 files, 35 tests.
- **PASS:** `npm run typecheck`
- **PASS:** `npx eslint src/data/wolves-lore-records.ts src/components/wolves/lore.ts src/tests/wolvesLoreColumn.test.ts`

## 2026-07-14: Final whole-series review follow-up

- Restored the final news warning's local `thesis-warning-fade` animation: it fades from full opacity to `0.35` over 20 seconds only when the separately passed warning is present. The Track 0 HUD and lower thesis text remain separate.
- Migrated the remaining quote identities into Markdown frontmatter, including the legacy source-label attribution and context values. Quote rendering now requires authored attribution, renders authored context, and has no source-label fallback. The remaining URL lookup is limited to source provenance records.
- Added regressions for quote-attribution diagnostics, all nine authored quote identities, rendered authored attribution/context, removed legacy quote labels, the missing-attribution rendering guard, the final warning animation class, and the existing finale state.
- **PASS:** focused Wolves suites — 76 tests across 6 files; `npm run typecheck`; scoped ESLint.
- **PASS:** local real-player verification at Track 0 405 and 408 seconds plus the terminal state: HUD, lower thesis overlay, and right-column warning were asserted independently on desktop and 390px mobile. Desktop/mobile screenshots were reviewed and removed.
- **Concern:** the live Track 0 reports 424 seconds while the authored timeline ends at 425; its terminal state was verified at the real 7:03/7:04 endpoint without changing authored timing.
