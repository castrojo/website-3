# Skill Improvement

Every completed implementation has two possible outputs:

1. The requested work.
2. A reusable learning, only when the session found one.

Update the closest existing skill in the same change when the learning is durable, non-obvious, and useful to future agents.

| Discovery | Action |
|---|---|
| Reusable repository behavior | Update the owning skill |
| Project-internal fact | Add a command or source path that re-derives it |
| One-off task detail | Keep it out of skills |
| New domain with distinct authority or verification | Create one focused skill; add it to the router and index |
| Contradiction | Correct the canonical owner; do not add another copy |

## Banned

- Changelogs, session logs, progress notes, plan files, and append-only agent journals.
- Ephemeral CI or deployment status in skills.
- New skills when an existing skill owns the domain.
- Duplicated non-negotiables.

## Verification

- [ ] The learning is reusable.
- [ ] The closest owner was updated.
- [ ] Router and index changed only if discovery needs changed.
- [ ] No stale status or session narrative was committed.
