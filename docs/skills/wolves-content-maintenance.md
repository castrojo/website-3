# Wolves Content Maintenance

Read `docs/wolves-maintenance.md` before touching any Wolves file. It is the canonical production reference.

**Agents edit documented content surfaces. Agents never edit Wolves design.**

## Core Process

1. Match the request to an open surface in `docs/wolves-maintenance.md`.
2. If the required path or behavior is locked, stop.
3. Apply user-supplied prose exactly; `editorial-policy.md` owns authorship rules.
4. Keep Track 0 layers separate:
   - top-bar communications: `src/data/wolves-incoming-signal.txt`
   - thesis overlay: `src/data/wolves-thesis-sequence.ts`, locked
   - lore column: `src/data/lore/*.md`
   - later-track team chat: `src/data/wolves-team-chats.ts`
5. Never hand-edit `src/components/wolves/wallpapers-list.ts`.
6. Preserve Track 0, timeline anchors, fixed slide windows, playlist order, and gallery shuffle rules exactly as documented.
7. Load `build-verify-deploy.md` and complete every Wolves-specific check from the canonical reference.

## Stop Immediately

- Any `.vue`, `.scss`, layout, typography, animation, control, or rendering change.
- Any thesis text or timing change without explicit authorization.
- A new lore kind or component.
- Text moving between signal, thesis, lore, or team-chat layers.
- Generated fiction or reconstructed prose.
- Spotify playback proposed to drive Wolves visuals.

## Verification

- [ ] Diff is confined to documented open surfaces.
- [ ] Authored prose is exact.
- [ ] Locked thesis and timeline data remain unchanged.
- [ ] Relevant tests, build, and real-player timestamp checks pass.
- [ ] Exact pushed-SHA deployment and affected live state are verified.
