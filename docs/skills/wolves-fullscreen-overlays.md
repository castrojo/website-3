# Wolves Fullscreen Overlays

This is engineering work on a frozen design surface. Explicit authorization is required. Read `docs/wolves-maintenance.md` and `docs/wolves-cinematic.md` first.

## Core Patterns

- A transformed ancestor contains `position: fixed`; wrap true fullscreen overlays in `<Teleport to="body">`.
- Tests for teleported content query `document.body`, not the component wrapper.
- Reuse `src/composables/useYoutubeIframeApi.ts`; reset its module cache in tests.
- happy-dom tests loading a real script URL set `handleDisabledFileLoadingAsSuccess = true`.
- Re-check cancellation or skip state after every `await` before side effects.
- Read scrub-derived state immediately; the live player poll loop can overwrite test positions.
- Shared control geometry belongs in the shared control component, not a parent's scoped style.
- Test embeds through `projectbluefin.io.localhost`; compare localhost error 150 with production before declaring a source broken.
- Keep fixed media from collapsing adjacent text columns; inspect computed grid columns and bounds.
- Theater typography is owned by `docs/wolves-maintenance.md`; never shrink type to fit copy.

## Red Flags

- A fullscreen overlay without Teleport.
- Wrapper-scoped selectors for teleported DOM.
- Duplicate YouTube API loaders.
- Async side effects after an unchecked `await`.
- Controls present in DOM with zero or clipped bounds.
- Downloaded or re-encoded third-party footage.
- A visual change without desktop and mobile browser evidence.

## Verification

- [ ] Explicit design authorization exists.
- [ ] Desktop and mobile Chromium checks cover bounds, controls, overflow, and scroll behavior.
- [ ] YouTube consumers reuse the shared loader and test reset.
- [ ] Relevant real-player states are verified.
- [ ] `build-verify-deploy.md` and the Wolves references are complete.
