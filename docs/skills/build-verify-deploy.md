# Build, Verify, Deploy

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `npm install --include=dev` |
| Develop | `npm run dev` |
| Format and lint | `npm run lint:fix` |
| Type-check | `npm run typecheck` |
| Test | `npm run test:run` |
| Build | `npm run build` |
| Preview | `npm run preview` |
| Navbar browser assertions | `node tests/navbar-visual.mjs` |

Use the smallest relevant checks. Documentation-only changes need path/link checks and `git diff --check`, not unrelated application test suites.

## Worktree Safety

- Inspect `git status --short` before staging.
- Never stage, restore, or commit unrelated user changes.
- `npm run test:run` may modify `public/dakota-versions.json`; leave it unstaged unless intentionally changed.
- Stage explicit paths. Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`.

## Visual and Wolves Verification

- Approved visual changes require desktop and mobile screenshots.
- Wolves changes follow `docs/wolves-maintenance.md`, including real-player checks at affected Track 0 timestamps.
- A successful build is not proof that a visual or timeline change works.
- CI runs Vitest and `tests/wolves-movie-flow.mjs`. Other browser scripts, including navbar and timestamp-specific Wolves oracles, remain manual unless the workflow source shows otherwise.

## Production Completion

After pushing:

```bash
sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
gh run list \
  --repo projectbluefin/website \
  --workflow "Deploy to GitHub Pages" \
  --commit "$sha" \
  --limit 1 \
  --json databaseId,headSha,status,conclusion,url
```

Production is complete only when the run for the exact pushed SHA is `completed` with conclusion `success`. No matching run, an in-progress run, or a failed run is not complete.

## Verification

- [ ] Relevant checks passed.
- [ ] Manual browser checks match the changed behavior.
- [ ] Only intended paths are staged and committed.
- [ ] Exact pushed-SHA Pages deployment succeeded.
- [ ] Wolves live checks passed when applicable.
