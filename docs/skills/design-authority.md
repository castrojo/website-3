# Design Authority

## Authority

| Surface | Default |
|---|---|
| Wolves | Design frozen. Only documented content surfaces are open. |
| Established pages and components | Get explicit human approval before editing visual files. |
| Explicitly requested new pages or components | Design work is allowed through the repository design workflow. |
| Content, data, and bug-fix requests | No implied design authority. |

## Stop Before Editing

Stop if the change affects:

- Vue template structure or component hierarchy
- SCSS, Tailwind classes, spacing, typography, color, or animation
- responsive layout or visual hierarchy
- navigation, sitemap inclusion, `noindex`, or page prominence
- any Wolves layout, timing, controls, lore rendering, or thesis surface

An explicit content, behavior, or bug-fix request does not authorize redesign.

## Approved Visual Work

1. Confirm the exact surface and intended outcome.
2. Follow existing visual patterns; do not create a parallel design system.
3. Keep experiments local until reviewed.
4. Capture desktop and mobile screenshots.
5. Verify interaction, responsive behavior, console output, and bounds.
6. Do not commit or push until the screenshots are approved.

## Red Flags

- "Small spacing cleanup" without approval.
- Editing shared styles to solve one page.
- Making content fit by shrinking type.
- Promoting an unlisted page through navigation.
- Any Wolves visual diff.

## Verification

- [ ] Approval predates the visual edit.
- [ ] Diff is limited to the approved surface.
- [ ] Desktop and mobile screenshots were reviewed.
- [ ] Existing design conventions remain intact.
